## Installation Guide
### 1. [repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Provable-Repair-2682) is in here. Clone it to your local machine.

### 2. Install Gurobi (solver)

Reproducing experiments requires a Gurobi license. Please install Gurobi from the official website: [gurobi installation](https://www.gurobi.com/). Free academic licenses for students and researchers [Gurobi academic license](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses) are provided if needed.

Aside from the official instructions, the following steps might be helpful.

- Login to the Gurobi user portal.
- Go to the ["Licenses - Request" tab](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/licenses/request), genearte a "WLS Academic" license if you don't have one. If you already have a "WLS Academic" license, you might get an "[LICENSES_ACADEMIC_EXISTS] Cannot create academic license as other academic licenses already exists" error.
- Go to the "Home" tab, click "Licenses - Open the WLS manager" to open the WLS manager.
- In the WLS manager, you should see a license under the "Licenses" tab. Click "extend" if it has expired (it might take some time to take effect).
- Go to the "API Keys" tab, click the "CREATE API KEY" button to create a new license, download the generated `gurobi.lic` file by following the instructions and place it at the proper location.

Before running the experiments, ensure that your Gurobi license is properly installed and gurobipy works in Python.


### 3. Install uv (python environment manager)
Please install by following guide: [uv installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

The following command might be helpful for installation:

- For macOS/Linux:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
- For Windows (PowerShell):
```
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

After installation, ensure that `uv` command is available in your terminal. You might need to run the command shown in the output of the installation script.


### 4. Setup python version
The project requires Python 3.12. Please install and pin the version using uv:
```
uv python install 3.12
cd [repository folder]
uv python pin 3.12
```

### 5. Create uv environment and install dependencies
```
uv sync
```
This command:
- creates a virtual environment (.venv)
- installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
- ensure the environment uses Python 3.12

### 6. Install Datasets
In our experiments, we use the following datasets:
- CIFAR10
- [MNIST-C](https://zenodo.org/records/3239543)
- [CIFAR10-C](https://zenodo.org/records/2535967)
- [GTSRB](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)

CIFAR10 is already included in the `torchvision` package, so you don't need to download it separately.

For MNIST-C and CIFAR10-C, you can download the datasets by running the following commands:
```
mkdir data
cd data

# mnist-c
wget https://zenodo.org/record/3239543/files/mnist_c.zip
unzip mnist_c.zip

# cifar10-c
wget -O cifar10_c.tar https://zenodo.org/records/2535967/files/CIFAR-10-C.tar
tar -xf cifar10_c.tar
```
For GTSRB, you can download the dataset from Kaggle. You need to create a Kaggle account and generate an API token. After downloading, make sure to rename the folder to `gtsrb` and place it in the `data` folder.



## Executing Experiments
### APRNN
```
uv run test_aprnn.py --net-id 0
```
You can switch the network by changing the `--net-id` argument. We currently support the following networks:
- net-id 0: mnist f1
- net-id 1: mnist f2

\# perturbed dimensions is already set to (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) in the code. You can change it by modifying the `ndims_list` variable in `test_prorepair.py`.

### ProRepair
```
uv run test_prorepair.py --exe-id 0
```
You can switch the experiment by changing the `--exe-id` argument. We currently support the following experiments:
- exe-id 0: (mnist f1, nonzero)
- exe-id 1: (mnist f1, all)
- exe-id 2: (mnist f2, nonzero)
- exe-id 3: (mnist f2, all)

where (model_name, pick) respectively corresponds to the model and the type of perturbation. As described in the paper, we execute the experiments with different numbers of perturbed dimensions (\#DIM) and different numbers of perturbed boxes (\#P). `nonzero` and `all` respectively correspond to the two types of perturbations. The perturbed dimensions are already set to (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) in the code. You can change it by modifying the `ndims_list` variable in `test_prorepair.py`. The number of perturbed boxes is already set to (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) in the code. You can change it by modifying the `N_list` variable in `test_prorepair.py`.

### PREPARED, LLR (last layer repair)
For PREPARED:
```
uv run test_prepared.py --exe-id 0
```
For LLR (last layer repair):
```
uv run test_lastlayer.py --exe-id 0
```
You can switch the experiment by changing the `--exe-id` argument. We currently support the following experiments:
- exe-id 0: (mnist-f1, nonzero)
- exe-id 1: (mnist-f1, all)
- exe-id 2: (mnist-f2, nonzero)
- exe-id 3: (mnist-f2, all)
- exe-id 4: (cifar-c, all)
- exe-id 5: (gtsrb-c, all)

where (model_name, pick) respectively corresponds to the model and the type of perturbation. As "ProRepair" experiments, we already set the perturbed dimensions to (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) in the code. You can change it by modifying the `ndims_list` variable in `test_prepared.py` (`test_lastlayer.py`). The number of perturbed boxes is already set to (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12) for "mnist-f1" and "mnist-f2", (12, 14, 16, 18, 20) for "cifar-c", and (4, 6, 8, 10, 12) for "gtsrb-c" in the code. You can change it by modifying the `N_list` variable in `test_prepared.py` (`test_lastlayer.py`).

### MULAR (our method)
```
uv run test.py --exe-id 0
```
You can switch the experiment by changing the `--exe-id` argument. We currently support the following experiments:
- exe-id 0: (mnist-f1, nonzero)
- exe-id 1: (mnist-f1, all)
- exe-id 2: (mnist-f2, nonzero)
- exe-id 3: (mnist-f2, all)
- exe-id 4: (cifar-c, all)
- exe-id 5: (gtsrb-c, all)

where (model_name, pick) respectively corresponds to the model and the type of perturbation. As experiments so far, we already set the perturbed dimensions to (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) in the code. You can change it by modifying the `ndims_list` variable in `test.py`. The number of perturbed boxes is already set to (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12) for "mnist-f1" and "mnist-f2", (12, 14, 16, 18, 20) for "cifar-c", and (4, 6, 8, 10, 12) for "gtsrb-c" in the code. You can change it by modifying the `N_list` variable in `test.py`.
